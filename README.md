# admin-dashboard

This is a simple admin dashboard built using HTML and CSS. It utilizes CSS Grid and flexbox for layout and
responsiveness. It is responsive to an extent, but it is designed for desktop screens.

Some features include:

- A sidebar with a logo and navigation links that highlight when hovered over.
- A header with a search bar, user profile, welcome message and buttons
- A main content area with project cards, Announcement and Trending sections.
- Project cards indicate when they are being interacted with by scaling up slightly.
- All interactable icons scale up slightly when hovered and scale down while clicked.
